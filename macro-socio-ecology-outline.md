ABSTRACT
========

Increasing human pressure on the planet from population, extractive and
consumptive activity leads to resource scarcity and risks of crossing
so-called planetary boundaries putting the human specis, other species
and the entire earth system at risk. Further, with increasing demand of
both continuing economic and social development along with a good and
healthy environment and resources for the future - the need for a
macroscopic view on how human resource use relates to the state of
environment, as well as social and economic outcomes is needed.

The socio-ecological approach considers human activities as embedded and
interacting with the biosphere. Socio-ecological systems have
historically been considered when humans interact with the environment
in extractive activities, often in marine or forest ecosystems.

At the core of the socio-ecological systems approach are questions about
the dynamics of how governance systems affects the way humans interact
with the environment and what they get out of their interaction with the
environment.

Socio-ecological approaches, however, have a history of having been
applied largely to local dynamics and to simple systems that can be
analyzed analytically. As such, the socio-ecological approach has not
delivered a guiding framework for how society can co-evolve in the
long-term from the global to the national and regional scale.

In parrallel, global, regional or national frameworks for looking at
socio-ecological dynamics have been developed. However, they have rarely
been phrased explicitly as such.

Here we provide an overall framework for what can be considered a
macro-socio-ecology. We tie together classic socio-ecological research
with recent large scale approaches of similar character. We outline main
research questions for macro-socio-ecology, its main methodological
toolbox, and its policy and governance relevance.

THE NEED
========

-   Success of socio-ecology
-   A strong micro-level foundation
-   Recent foundational concepts
-   Planetary boundaries
-   Social foundation
-   Doughnut economics
-   A guiding national, regional and world map
-   not a GPS that will tell you how to get to where you want
-   To inspire discussions
    -   About what we use our resources for
    -   About the efficiency with which we use resources - environmental
        (extraction, transport), social, economic
-   Plenty of data - fragile framework
    -   The national, regional and global level of organization

### **Environmental impact**

*I* = *P**A**T* ⇔ *I* = *P**A**C**T*

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### **Developmental outcome**

*D* = *P**A**E*

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### **Development outcome per environmental impact**

$\\frac{D}{I} = \\frac{PAE}{PAT} = \\frac{E}{T}$

$\\frac{D}{I} = \\frac{PAE}{PACT} = \\frac{E}{CT}$

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### **Where are the resources?**

Implicit in $C & T$

### *Making resources explicit:*

*R**e**s**o**u**r**c**e**s*, *e**x**t**r**a**c**t**e**d* : *R*<sub>*e*</sub>, *c**o**n**s**u**m**e**d* : *R*<sub>*c*</sub>, *i**m**p**o**r**t**e**d* : *R*<sub>*i*</sub>, *e**x**p**o**r**t**e**d* : *R*<sub>*o*</sub>

*R*<sub>*o*</sub> + *R*<sub>*c*</sub> = *R*<sub>*i*</sub> + *R*<sub>*e*</sub>

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### **Environmental, social and economic impacts of resource use**

Using the same subscripts for I, D and economic measures *E**c*, for now
denoting equity by *E**q*.

Total environmental impacts of resource use.

$\\frac {I}{R} = \\frac{I}{R\_o + R\_c + R\_i + R\_e} = \\frac{I\_o}{R\_o} + \\frac{I\_c}{R\_c} + \\frac{I\_i}{R\_i} + \\frac{I\_e}{R\_e}$

Similar statements apply for *E**c* and *D*.

$\\frac{Ec}{R} = \\frac{Ec}{R\_o + R\_c + R\_i + R\_e} = \\frac{Ec\_o}{R\_o} + \\frac{Ec\_c}{R\_c} + \\frac{Ec\_i}{R\_i} + \\frac{Ec\_e}{R\_e}$

$\\frac{D}{R} = \\frac{D}{R\_o + R\_c + R\_i + R\_e} = \\frac{D\_o}{R\_o} + \\frac{D\_c}{R\_c} + \\frac{D\_i}{R\_i} + \\frac{D\_e}{R\_e}$

One or more of the flows may be (set to) null depending on the question
or type of process investigated.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### **Net outcomes versus outcomes associated with consumption of resources gains and losses ass**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### **Resource consumption elasticities of D, I, Ec**

log(*v**a**r*) = *a* + *b* \* log(*R*<sub>*c*</sub>)

*e**l**a**s**t**i**c**i**t**y* = *ϵ* = *b*

**Research question**

Rank variables with regard to *b*. Assume other model than linear?

Variables with high cross-country resource elasticities should be
scrutinized for more in-depth analysis. E.g. outliers within continents
or development stages with partiularly high or low resource use per
sustainability outcome.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### **Elasticity of consumed resources to consumption balance**

log(*v**a**r*) = *a* + *b* \* log(*R*<sub>*c**i*</sub>) + *c* \* log(*R*<sub>*c**e*</sub>)

Where *R*<sub>*c**i*</sub> and *R*<sub>*c**e*</sub> are the resources
consumed through imports and domestic extraction, respectively.

***Assuming equal proportional contributions to export from extracted
and imported resources***

$\\log(var) = a + b \* \\log \\left( R\_i \* \\left(\\frac {R\_i}{R\_c+R\_o} \\right) \\right) + c \* \\log \\left( R\_e \* \\left(\\frac{R\_e}{R\_c+R\_o} \\right) \\right)$

***Assuming exports first by domestic resources, then by imported
resources of vice versa***

Needs to be filled in.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### **Elasticity of consumption balance**

$\\log(var) = a + b \* \\log \\left(\\frac{\\left( R\_{ce} - R\_{ci} \\right)}{\\left( R\_{ce} + R\_{ci} \\right)}\\right)$

Where *R*<sub>*c**i*</sub> and *R*<sub>*c**e*</sub> are the resources
consumed through imports and domestic extraction, respectively.

***Assuming equal proportional contributions to export from extracted
and imported resources***

$\\log(var) = a + b \* \\log \\left( \\frac{\\left( R\_{e} - R\_{i} \\right)}{\\left( R\_{e} + R\_{i} \\right)} \*  \\frac{\\left( R\_{c} \\right)}{\\left( R\_{c} + R\_{o} \\right)} \\right)$

***Assuming exports first by domestic resources, then by imported
resources of vice versa***

        force) (modeled ILO estimate)** (N=172, 1991-2012). Unemployment
        refers to the share of the labor force that is without work but
        available for and seeking employment.

        decit indicates how many calories would be needed to lift the
        undernourished from their status, everything else being
        constant. The average intensity of food deprivation of the
        undernourished, estimated as the dierence between the average
        dietary energy requirement and the average dietary energy
        consumption of the undernourished population (food-deprived), is
        multiplied by the number of undernourished to provide an
        estimate of the total food decit in the country, which is then
        normalized by the total population.

    -   *QoG variables*

    -   4.9.2 ciri\_disap **Disappearance** (1981-2011). Disappearances
        are cases in which people have disappeared, political motivation
        appears likely, and the victims have not been found. Knowledge
        of the whereabouts of the disappeared is, by denition ,not
        public knowledge. However, while there is typically no way of
        knowing where victims are, it is typically known by whom they
        were taken and under what circumstances. A score of 0 indicates
        that disappearances have occurred frequently in a given year; a
        score of 1 indicates that disappearances occasionally occurred;
        and a score of 2 indicates that disappearances did not occur in
        a given year.

    -   4.9.8 ciri\_kill **Extrajudicial Killing** (1981-2011).
        Extrajudicial killings are killings by government ocials
        without due process of law. They include murders by private
        groups if instigated by government. These killings may result
        from the deliberate, illegal, and excessive use of lethal force
        by the police, security forces, or other agents of the state
        whether against criminal suspects, detainees, prisoners, or
        others. A score of 0 indicates that extrajudicial killings were
        practiced frequently in a given year; a score of 1 indicates
        that extrajudicial killings were practiced occasionally; and a
        score of 2 indicates that such killings did not occur in a given
        year.

    -   4.9.10 ciri\_physint **Physical Integrity Rights Index**
        (1981-2011). This is an additive index constructed from the
        Torture, Extrajudicial Killing, Political Imprisonment, and
        Disappearance indicators. It ranges from 0 (no government
        respect for these four rights) to 8 (full government respect for
        these four rights).

    -   4.9.14 ciri\_tort **Torture** (1981-2011). Torture refers to the
        purposeful inicting of extreme pain, whether mental or
        physical, by government ocials or by private individuals at the
        instigation of government ocials. Torture includes the use of
        physical and other force by police and prison guards that is
        cruel, inhuman, or degrading. This also includes deaths in
        custody due to negligence by government ocials. A score of 0
        indicates that torture was practiced frequently in a given year;
        a score of 1 indicates that torture was practiced occasionally;
        and a score of 2 indicates that torture did not occur in a given
        year.

    -   4.23.1 gd\_ptsa **Political Terror Scale - Amnesty
        International** (N=188, 1976-2012, [1:5]). Political Terror
        Scale Levels: 5. Terror has expanded to the whole population.
        The leaders of these societies place no limits on the means or
        thoroughness with which they pursue personal or ideological
        goals. 4. Civil and political rights violations have expanded to
        large numbers of the population. Murders, disappearances,and
        torture are a common part of life. In spite of its generality,
        on this level terror aects those who interest themselves in
        politics or ideas. 3. There is extensive political imprisonment,
        or a recent history of such imprisonment. Execution or other
        political murders and brutality may be common. Unlimited
        detention, with or without a trial, forpolitical views is
        accepted. 2. There is a limited amount of imprisonment for
        nonviolent political activity. However, few persons are aected,
        torture and beatings are exceptional. Political murder is rare.

        -   4.9.1 ciri\_assn **Freedom of Assembly and Association**
            (1981-2011). It is an internationally recognized right of
            citizens to assemble freely and to associate with other
            persons in political parties, trade unions, cultural
            organizations, or other special-interest groups. This
            variable indicates the extent to which the freedoms of
            assembly and association are subject to actual governmental
            limitations or restrictions (as opposed to strictly legal
            protections). A score of 0 indicates that citizens' rights
            to freedom of assembly or association were severely
            restricted or denied completely to all citizens; a score of
            1 indicates that these rights were limited for all citizens
            or severely restricted or denied for select groups; and a
            score of 2 indicates that these rights wer virtually
            unrestricted and freely enjoyed by practically all citizens
            in a given year.

        -   4.9.4 ciri\_empinx\_new **Empowerment Rights Index (New)**
            (1981-2011). This is an additive index constructed from the
            Foreign Movement, Domestic Movement, Freedom of Speech,
            Freedom of Assembly and Association, Workers' Rights,
            Electoral Self-Determination, and Freedom of Religion
            indicators. It ranges from 0 (no government respect for
            these seven rights) to 14 (full government respect for these
            seven rights).

        -   4.9.5 ciri\_empinx\_old **Empowerment Rights Index (Old)**
            (1981-2011). This is an additive index constructed from the
            Freedom of Movement, Freedom of Speech, Workers' Rights,
            Political Participation, and Freedom of Religion indicators.
            It ranges from 0 (no government respect for these ve
            rights) to 10 (full government respect for these ve
            rights). Note: Starting wit hthe 2007 coding, this variable
            was retired in favor of the newer index ciri\_empinx\_new.

        -   4.9.11 ciri\_polpris **Political Imprisonment** (1981-2011).
            Political imprisonment refers to the incarceration of people
            by government ocials because of their speech; their
            non-violent opposition to government policies or leaders;
            their religious beliefs; their non-violent religious
            practices including proselytizing; or their membership in a
            group, including an ethnic or racial group. A score of 0
            indicates that there were many people imprisoned because of
            their religious, political, or other beliefs in a given
            year; a score of 1 indicates that a few people were
            imprisoned; and a score of 2 indicates that no persons were
            imprisoned for any of the above reasons in a given year.

        -   4.9.13 ciri\_speech **Freedom of Speech** (1981-2011). This
            variable indicates the extent to which freedoms of speech
            and press are aected by government censorship, including
            ownership of media outlets. Censorship is any form of
            restriction that is placed on freedom of the press, speech
            or expression. Expression may be in the form of art or
            music. A score of 0 indicates that government censorship of
            the media was complete; a score of 1 indicates that there
            was some government censorship of the media; and a score of
            2 indicates that there was no government censorship of the
            media in a given year.

        -   4.20.1 fh\_cl **Civil Liberties** (N=207, 1972-2012,
            [1:7])Civil liberties allow for the freedoms of expression
            and belief, associational and organizational rights, rule of
            law, and personal autonomy without interference from the
            state. The more specic list of rights considered vary over
            the years. Countries are graded between 1 (most free) and 7
            (least free).

        -   4.20.3 fh\_fotpsc5 **Freedom of the Press, Score
            (2001-2012)** (N=196, 2001-2012, [0:100]) The press freedom
            index is computed by adding three component ratings: Laws
            and regulations, Political pressures and controls and
            Economic Inuences. The scale ranges from 0 (most free) to
            100 (least free).

        -   4.44.1 rsf\_p **Press Freedom Index** The Press Freedom
            index measures the amount of freedom journalists and the
            media have in each country and the eorts made by governments
            to see that press freedom is respected. It does not take
            account of all human rights violations, only those that aect
            press freedom. Neither is it an indicator of the quality of
            a country's media. Note: With the exception of the year 2012
            the index ranges between 0 (total press freedom) and 100 (no
            press freedom). However for the 2012 data release RSF
            changed the scale so that negative values can be and indeed
            are assigned to countries with more press freedom. We have
            decided leave the data as is.

            guaranteed in law, but severely prohibited in practice. A
            score of 2 indicates that women's political rights were
            guaranteed in law, but were still moderately prohibited in

            work, Free choice of profession or employment without the
            need to obtain a husband or male relative's consent, The
            right to gainful employment without the need to obtain a

            economic rights for women in law and that systematic
            discrimination based on sex may have been built into law. A
            score of 1 indicates that women had some economic rights
            under law, but these rights were not effectively enforced. A
            score of 2 indicates that women had some economic rights
            under law, and the government effectively enforced these
            rights in practice while still allowing a low level of
            discrimination against women in economic matters. Finally, a
            score of 3 indicates that all or nearly all of women's
            economic rights were guaranteed by law and the government
            fully and vigorously enforces these laws in practice.

    -   *QoG variables*

        -   **The Worldwide Governance Indicators** These indicators are
            based on several hundred individual variables measuring
            perceptions of governance, drawn from 31 separate data
            sources constructed by 25 dierent organizations. These
            individual measures of governance are assigned to categories
            capturing key dimensions of governance. An unobserved
            component model is used to construct six aggregate
            governance indicators. Point estimates of the dimensions of
            governance, the margins of error as well as the number of
            sources are presented for each country. The governance
            estimates are normally distributed with a mean of zero and a
            standard deviation of one each year of measurement. This
            implies that virtually all scores lie between -2.5 and 2.5,
            with higher scores corresponding to better outcomes.
            WARNING: Since the estimates are standardized (with a mean
            of zero and a standard deviation of one) each year of
            measurement, they are not directly suitable for over-time
            comparisons within countries. Kaufmann et al. (2006) however
            nd no systematic time-trends in a selection of indicators
            that do allow for comparisons over time, which suggests that
            time-series information in the WBGI scores can be used if
            interpreted with caution.

        -   4.55.1 wbgi\_cce **Control of Corruption - Estimate**
            (N=193, 1996-2012, mean=0, sd=1). Control of Corruption -
            Estimate: "Control of Corruption" measures perceptions of
            corruption, conventionally dened as the exercise of public
            power for private gain. The particular aspect of corruption
            measured by the various sources diers somewhat, ranging from
            the frequency of "additional payments to get things done",
            to the eects of corruption on the business environment, to
            measurin "grand corruption" in the political arena or in the
            tendency of elite forms to engage in "state capture".

        -   4.55.3 wbgi\_gee **Government Eectiveness - Estimate**
            (N=193, 1996-2012, mean=0, sd=1). Government Eectiveness -
            Estimate: "Government Eectiveness" combines into a single
            grouping responses on the quality of public service
            provision, the quality of the bureaucracy, the competence of
            civil servants, the independence of the civil service from
            political pressures, and the credibility of the government's
            commitment to policies. The main focus of this index is on
            "inputs" required for the government to be able to produce
            and implement good policies and deliver public goods.

        -   4.55.5 wbgi\_pse **Political Stability - Estimate** (N=195,
            1996-2012, mean=0, sd=1). Political Stability - Estimate:
            "Political Stability" combines several indicators which
            measure perceptions of the likelihood that the government in
            power will be destabilized or overthrown by possibly
            unconstitutional and/or violent means, including domestic
            violence and terrorism.

        -   4.55.7 wbgi\_rle **Rule of Law - Estimate** (N=195,
            1996-2012, mean=0, sd=1). Rule of Law - Estimate: "Rule of
            Law" includes several indicators which measure the extent to
            which agents have condence in and abide by the rules of
            society. These include perceptions of the incidence of
            crime, the eectiveness and predictability of the judiciary,
            and the enforceability of contracts. Together, these
            indicators measure the success of a society in developing an
            environment in which fair and predictable rules form the
            basis for economic and social interactions and the extent to
            which property rights are protected.

        -   "**Contestation and Inclusiveness, (1950-2000)** These are
            the two principal components of 13-15 indicators of

            Polity; Arthur Banks; Alvarez, Cheibub, Limongi, and
            Przeworski, as updated by Cheibub and Gandhi; Bollen; and
            Cingranelli and Richards. The dataset covers most countries
            in the world from 1950 through 2000. In an article in the
            Journal of Politics (July 2008), Angel Alvarez, Claudia
            Maldonado, and I argue that these principal components,
            which capture 75 percent of variation in the most commonly
            used democracy indicators, measure Robert Dahl's two
            dimensions of polyarchy: contestation and inclusiveness. We
            recommend that scholars use the standardized versions of
            these components (CONTESTstd and INCLUSstd), which have been
            adjusted to be comparable from year to year."

            branch of the government or the military. A score of 0
            indicates "not independent"", a score of 1 indicates

        -   4.20.6 fh\_pr **Political Rights** (N=207, 1972-2012,
            [0:7]). Political rights enable people to participate freely
            in the political process, including the right to vote freely
            for distinct alternatives in legitimate elections, compete
            for public oce, join political parties and organizations,
            and elect representatives who have a decisive impact on
            public policies and are accountable to the electorate. The
            specic list of rights considered varies over the years.
            Countries are graded between 1 (most free) and 7 (least
            free).

        -   4.20.7 fh\_status **Status** (N=207, 1972-2012, [0:7]). (1)
            Free. (2) Partly Free. (3) Not Free. Until 2003, countries
            whose combined average ratings for Political Rights and
            Civil Liberties fell between 1.0 and 2.5 were designated
            "Free""; between 3.0 and 5.5 "Partly Free"", and between 5.5
            and 7.0 "Not Free". Since then, countries whose ratings
            average 1.0 to 2.5 are considered "Free"", 3.0 to 5.0
            "Partly Free", and 5.5 to 7.0 "Not Free".

        -   4.28.2 h\_polcon3 **Political Constraints Index III**
            (N=201, 1946-2012, [0:1]). This index measures the
            feasibility of policy change, i.e. the extent to which a
            change in the preferences of any one political actor may
            lead to a change in government policy. The index is composed
            from the following information: the number of independent
            branches of government with veto power over policy change,
            counting the executive and the presence of an eective lower
            and upper house in the legislature (more branches leading to
            more constraint); the extent of party alignment across
            branches of government, measured as the extent to which the
            same party or coalition of parties control each branch
            (decreasing the level of constraint); and the extent of
            preference heterogeneity within each legislative branch,
            measured as legislative fractionalization in the relevant
            house (increasing constraint for aligned executives,
            decreasing it for opposed executives). The index scores are
            derived from a simple spatial model and theoretically ranges
            from 0 to 1, with higher scores indicating more political
            constraint and thus less feasibility of policy change. Note
            that the coding reects information as of January 1 in any
            given year. Henisz (2002) uses this index to demonstrate
            that political environments that limit the feasibility of
            policy change are an important determinant of investment in
            infrastructure.

        -   4.33.1 icrg\_qog **ICRG Indicator of Quality of Government**
            (N=147, 1984-2012, [0:1]). The mean value of the ICRG
            variables "Corruption"", "Law and Order" and "Bureaucracy
            Quality", scaled 0-1. Higher values indicate higher quality
            of government.

        -   **Institutional Quality Dataset** More than 30 established
            institutional indicators can be clustered into three
            homogeneous groups of formal institutions: legal, political
            and economic, which capture to a large extent the complete
            formal institutional environment of a country. The latent
            qualities of legal, political and economic institutions for
            every country in the world and for every year are
            calculated. On this basis, a legal, political and economic
            World Institutional Quality Ranking are proposed, through
            which one can follow whether a country is improving or
            worsening its relative institutional environment. The
            calculated latent institutional quality measures can be
            useful in further panel data applications and add to the
            usual practice of using simply one or another index of
            institutional quality to capture the institutional
            environment.

        -   **Unified Democracy Scores** Unied Democracy Scores (UDS),
            now covering the time period 1946-2012. These new scores
            incorporate recent updates to three of the ten original
            measures-Freedom House (2014), Polity IV (Marshall et al.
            2012), and VanHanen (2012)-that feature in the analysis that
            we report in our 2010 article. In addition, the current
            release adds a recently developed measure of
            democracy-Economist Intelligence Unit (2012)-to our
            framework. Using the most current release of the UDS, we
            have replicated gure 3 from the original article to provide
            users with a snapshot of the updated scores, focusing on the
            year 2000.

        -   4.49.1 uds\_mean **Unified Demo. Score Posterior (Mean)**
            (N=210, 1946-2012). Unified Demo. Score Posterior (Mean).
            Higher score, better democracy.

        -   4.49.1 uds\_median **Unified Demo. Score Posterior
            (Median)** (N=210, 1946-2012). Unified Demo. Score
            Posterior (Median). Higher score, better democracy.

        -   **Measures of Democracy 1810-2012** The data contain three
            dierent variables, created by Tatu Vanhanen in his long-term
            research, for each year from 1810 to 2012. The variables in
            question are political competition, political participation
            and the index of democratization.

        -   4.53.1 van\_comp **Competition** (N=200, 1946-2010). The
            competition variable portrays the electoral success of
            smaller parties, that is, the percentage of votes gained by
            the smaller parties in parliamentary and/or presidential
            elections. The variable is calculated by subtracting from
            100 the percentage of votes won by the largest party (the
            party which wins most votes) in parliamentary elections or
            by the party of the successful candidate in presidential
            elections. Depending on their importance, either
            parliamentary or presidential elections are used in the
            calculation of the variable, or both elections are used,
            with weights. If information on the distribution of votes is
            not available, or if the distribution does not portray the
            reality accurately, the distribution of parliamentary seats
            is used instead. If parliament members are elected but
            political parties are not allowed to take part in elections,
            it is assumed that one party has taken all votes or seats.
            In countries where parties are not banned but yet only
            independent candidates participate in elections, it is
            assumed that the share of the largest party is not over 30
            percent.

        -   4.53.2 van\_index **Index of Democratization** (N=200,
            1946-2010). The index of democratization is formed by
            multiplying the competition and the participation variables
            and then dividing the outcome by 100.

        -   4.53.3 van\_part **Participation** (N=200, 1946-2010). The
            political participation variable portrays the voting turnout
            in each election, and is calculated as the percentage of the
            total population who actually voted in the election. In the
            case of indirect elections, only votes cast in the nal
            election are taken into account. If electors have not been
            elected by citizens, only the number of actual electors is
            taken into account, which means that the degree of
            participation drops to the value 0. If an election to choose
            electors has been held, the participation variable is
            calculated from the number and distribution of votes in that
            election. National referendums raise the variable value by
            ve percent and state (regional) referendums by one percent
            for the year they are held. Referendums can add the degree
            of participation at maximum by 30 percent a year. The value
            of the combined degree of participation cannot be higher
            than 70 percent, even in cases where the sum of
            participation and referendums would be higher than 70.

        technology.

    -   4.56.30 wdi\_internetuse **Internet users (per 100 people)**
        (N=193, 1960-2012). Internet users are individuals who have used
        the Internet (from any location) in the last 12 months. Internet
        can be used via a computer, mobile phone, personal digital

        subscriptions are subscriptions to a public mobile telephone
        service using cellular technology, which provide access to the
        public switched telephone network. Post-paid and prepaid
        subscriptions are included.

            (1981-2011) This variable indicates citizens' freedom to
            travel within their own country. A score of 0 indicates that
            this freedom was severely restricted, a score of 1 indicates
            the freedom was somewhat restricted, and a score of 2
            indicates unrestricted freedom of foreign movement.

-   economic freedoms

    -   4.21.2 \_index\_cl **Economic Freedom of the World Index
        (chain-linked)** (N=123, 1970-2010, [0:10]). One problem with
        the version of the index of economic freedom (\_index) is that
        the underlying data is more complete in recent years than in
        earlier years. As a result, changes in the index ratings over
        time may reect the fact that some components are missing in
        some years but not in others.The problem of missing components
        threatens the comparability of the index ratings over time. In
        order to correct for this problem, the Fraser Institute has
        constructed a chain-linked summary index of economic freedom
        that is based on the 2000 rating as a base year. Changes to the
        index going backward (and forward) in time are then based only
        on changes in components that were present in adjacent years.
        The chain-linked methodology means that a country's rating will
        change across time periods only when there is a change in
        ratings for components present during both of the over-lapping
        years. This is precisely what one would want when making
        comparisons across time periods.

    -   4.29.1 hf\_corrupt **Freedom from Corruption** (N=183,
        1994-2013, [0:10]). This factor relies on Transparency
        International's Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI), which
        measures the level of corruption in 152 countries, to determine
        the freedom from corruption scores of countries that are also
        listed in the Index of Economic Freedom. The CPI is based on a
        10-point scale in which a score of 10 indicates very little
        corruption and a score of 0 indicates a very corrupt government.
        In scoring freedom from corruption, the authors convert each of
        these raw CPI data to a 0-100 scale by multiplying the CPI
        scores by 10.

    -   4.29.2 hf\_escore **Economic Freedom Index** (N=183, 1994-2013,
        [0:10]). The Economic Freedom index uses 10 specic freedoms,
        some as composites of even further detailed and quantiable
        components: Business freedom (hf\_business), Trade freedom
        (hf\_trade), Fiscal freedom (hf\_scal), Freedom from government
        (hf\_govt), Monetary freedom (hf\_monetary), Investment freedom
        (hf\_invest), Financial freedom (hf\_nanc), Property rights
        (hf\_prights), Freedom from corruption (hf\_corrupt), Labor
        freedom (hf\_labor). Each of these freedoms is weighted equally
        and turned into an index ranging from 0 to 100, where 100
        represents the maximum economic freedom. Although changes in
        methodology have been undertaken throughout the measurement
        period, continuous backtracking has been used to maximize
        comparability over time.

    -   4.29.3 hf\_govt **Freedom from Government** (N=182, 1994-2013,
        [0:100]). Scoring of the freedom from government factor is based
        on two components: Government expenditure as a percentage of
        GDP, Revenues generated by state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and
        property as a percentage of total government revenue. Government
        expenditure as a percentage of GDP is weighted as two-thirds of
        the freedom from government factor score, and revenue from SOEs
        is weighted as one-third. In cases where SOE data does not
        exist, the data is excluded from the factor score. The country's
        freedom from government ranges between 0 and 100, where 100
        represents the maximum degree of freedom from government.

    -   4.29.5 hf\_prights **Property Rights** (N=180, 1994-2013,
        [0:100]). This factor scores the degree to which a country's
        laws protect private property rights and the degree to which its
        government enforces those laws. It also accounts for the
        possibility that private property will be expropriated. In
        addition, it analyzes the independence of the judiciary, the
        existence of corruption within the judiciary, and the ability of
        individuals and businesses to enforce contracts. The less
        certain the legal protection of property is and the greater the
        chances of government expropriation of property are, the higher
        a country's score is. The country's property rights score ranges
        from 0 and 100, where 100 represents the maximum degree of
        protection of property rights.

    -   4.29.6 hf\_trade **Trade Freedom** (N=182, 1994-2013, [0:100]).
        The trade freedom score is based on two inputs: The
        trade-weighted average tari rate, Non-tariff barriers (NTBs).
        Weighted average taris is a purely quantitative measure and
        accounts for the basic calculation of the score. The presence of
        NTBs in a country aects its trade freedom score by incurring a
        penalty of up to 20 percentage points, or one-fth of the
        maximum score. The country's trade freedom ranges between 0 and
        100, where 100 represents the maximum degree of trade freedom.

    -   4.56.22 wdi\_forestarea **Forest area (% of land area)** (N=192,
        1990-2011). Forest area is land under natural or planted stands
        of trees of at least 5 meters in situ, whether productive or
        not, and excludes tree stands in agricultural production systems
        (for example, in fruit plantations and agroforestry systems) and
        trees in urban parks and gardens.

    -   4.56.32 wdi\_landagr **Agricultural land (% of land area)**
        (N=195, 1961-2011). Agricultural land refers to the share of
        land area that is arable, under permanent crops, and under
        permanent pastures. Arable land includes land dened by the FAO
        as land under temporary crop (double-cropped areas are counted
        once), temporary meadows for mowing or for pasture, land under
        market or kitchen gardens, and land temporarily fallow. Land
        abandoned as a result of shifting cultivation is excluded. Land
        under permanent crops is land cultivated with crops that occupy
        the land for long periods and need not be replanted after each
        harvest, such as cocoa, coee, and rubber. This category includes
        land under owering shrubs, fruit trees, nut trees, and vines,
        but excludes land under trees grown for wood or timber.
        Permanent pasture is land used for ve or more years for forage,
        including natural and cultivated crops.

    -   4.56.33 wdi\_landarea **Land area (sq. km)** (N=195, 1961-2011).
        Land area is a country's total area, excluding area under inland
        water bodies, national claims to continental shelf, and
        exclusive economic zones. In most cases the denition of inland
        water bodies includes major rivers and lakes.

        negative value indicates that the country is a net exporter.
        Energy use refers to use of primary energy before transformation
        to other end-use fuels, which is equal to indigenous production
        plus imports and stock changes, minus exports and fuels supplied
        to ships and aircraft engaged in international transport.

LIMITATIONS OF THE MRIO APPROACH
================================

From (Wiedmann et al. 2013)

-   "The two data sources used in this work are the global MRIO database
    Eora and the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research
    Organisation (CSIRO) Global Material Flow Database."

-   "S2.3. Methodological Limitations. Recent advances in global MRIO
    modeling (2, 12) now provide the means to analyze and monitor the MF
    of nations more reliably than before. However, the method is not
    without limitations. MRIO accounts are provided initially in
    monetary terms rather than physical terms. So-called "price errors"
    can be introduced where individual transactions occur with a
    different price (dollars per quantity) than average. Allocation
    errors can occur due to low sectoral or product resolution. For
    example, a kilogram of gold included in a broad category of
    materials (e.g., "ores") allocated to a broad production sector
    (e.g., "metals and mining") will not be traced to its final demand
    as accurately as if gold were differentiated as a distinct input
    category and the MRIO used distinguished, more specific "gold,"
    "precious metals," or "nonferrous metals" sectors rather than a
    broad metals and mining sector. In this study, we differentiated 35
    types of materials and the MRIO used between 25 and 510 industrial
    sectors per country (5). For countries with more raw
    material-producing sectors, the allocation of DE data are therefore
    more accurate than for countries where fewer such sectors are
    available. For example, if there is just one "aggregate" extraction
    sector, a part of the "building stone" material flow might be
    allocated to the chemical industry because some limestone (which is
    also extracted by the aggregate"

-   "The limited resolution of some national input-output tables also
    constrains the method's ability in addressing issues around critical
    metals and resource security due to the facts that (i) many of the
    critical metals are "specialty metals," which are use for very
    specific applications that cannot be easily represented by flows
    between aggregate sectors/products, and (ii) resource security
    roblems often arise from the presence of mono- or oligopoly
    structures within a sector. This is an area where hybrid approaches
    can be very useful. Here, input-output analysis (IOA) is combined
    with elements from process-based life cycle assessment (LCA)
    methods, such as those applied by Schoer et al. (13) in a study of
    the raw material consumption (RMC) of the European Union (EU). The
    hybrid method takes advantage of truncation-free enumeration of
    supply chains via IOA and productspecific detail via LCA (14-16).
    The current framework provides an important first step toward
    understanding potential risks associated with the global resource
    supply chain. More detailed information can be added targeting the
    hotspots identified through a hybrid approach, where
    process-specific information and aggregate product-level information
    are integrated. More general elaborations on the uncertainty of"

COMPARISON OF THE MRIO APPROACH TO TMC AND TMR
==============================================

TMR - Total Material Requirement

TMC - Total Materical Consumption

From (Wiedmann et al. 2013)

-   "To calculate TMC and TMR, material intensity factors of imports and
    exports are derived from simplified life cycle inventories (4, 25).
    A drawback of this LCA factor method is that "that the ecological
    rucksack of a good which is passing more than one border in one or
    different process stages is counted more than one time within the
    volume" (4). This double-counting problem does not occur inMF
    calculations based on IOA because DE volumes are merely reallocated
    from production to consumption in a mutually exclusive and
    collectively comprehensive way. A further complication of the factor
    method used in TMC/TMR calculations is that coefficients of indirect
    material flows of imports and exports are mostly derived from
    specific production systems, such as Germany or the EU (25).""
