ABSTRACT
========

Increasing human pressure on the planet from population, extractive and
consumptive activity leads to resource scarcity and risks of crossing
so-called planetary boundaries putting the human specis, other species
and the entire earth system at risk. Further, with increasing demand of
both continuing economic and social development along with a good and
healthy environment and resources for the future - the need for a
macroscopic view on how human resource use relates to the state of
environment, as well as social and economic outcomes is needed.

The socio-ecological approach considers human activities as embedded and
interacting with the biosphere. Socio-ecological systems have
historically been considered when humans interact with the environment
in extractive activities, often in marine or forest ecosystems.

At the core of the socio-ecological systems approach are questions about
the dynamics of how governance systems affects the way humans interact
with the environment and what they get out of their interaction with the
environment.

Socio-ecological approaches, however, have a history of having been
applied largely to local dynamics and to simple systems that can be
analyzed analytically. As such, the socio-ecological approach has not
delivered a guiding framework for how society can co-evolve in the
long-term from the global to the national and regional scale.

In parrallel, global, regional or national frameworks for looking at
socio-ecological dynamics have been developed. However, they have rarely
been phrased explicitly as such.

Here we provide an overall framework for what can be considered a
macro-socio-ecology. We tie together classic socio-ecological research
with recent large scale approaches of similar character. We outline main
research questions for macro-socio-ecology, its main methodological
toolbox, and its policy and governance relevance.

THE NEED
========

-   Success of socio-ecology
-   A strong micro-level foundation
-   Recent foundational concepts
-   Planetary boundaries
-   Social foundation
-   Doughnut economics
-   A guiding national, regional and world map
-   not a GPS that will tell you how to get to where you want
-   To inspire discussions
    -   About what we use our resources for
    -   About the efficiency with which we use resources - environmental
        (extraction, transport), social, economic
-   Plenty of data - fragile framework
    -   The national, regional and global level of organization

### **Environmental impact**

*I* = *P**A**T* ⇔ *I* = *P**A**C**T*

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### **Developmental outcome**

*D* = *P**A**E*

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### **Development outcome per environmental impact**

$\\frac{D}{I} = \\frac{PAE}{PAT} = \\frac{E}{T}$

$\\frac{D}{I} = \\frac{PAE}{PACT} = \\frac{E}{CT}$

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### **Where are the resources?**

Implicit in $C & T$

### *Making resources explicit:*

*R**e**s**o**u**r**c**e**s*, *e**x**t**r**a**c**t**e**d* : *R*<sub>*e*</sub>, *c**o**n**s**u**m**e**d* : *R*<sub>*c*</sub>, *i**m**p**o**r**t**e**d* : *R*<sub>*i*</sub>, *e**x**p**o**r**t**e**d* : *R*<sub>*o*</sub>

*R*<sub>*o*</sub> + *R*<sub>*c*</sub> = *R*<sub>*i*</sub> + *R*<sub>*e*</sub>

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### **Environmental, social and economic impacts of resource use**

Using the same subscripts for I, D and economic measures *E**c*, for now
denoting equity by *E**q*.

Total environmental impacts of resource use.

$\\frac {I}{R} = \\frac{I}{R\_o + R\_c + R\_i + R\_e} = \\frac{I\_o}{R\_o} + \\frac{I\_c}{R\_c} + \\frac{I\_i}{R\_i} + \\frac{I\_e}{R\_e}$

Similar statements apply for *E**c* and *D*.

$\\frac{Ec}{R} = \\frac{Ec}{R\_o + R\_c + R\_i + R\_e} = \\frac{Ec\_o}{R\_o} + \\frac{Ec\_c}{R\_c} + \\frac{Ec\_i}{R\_i} + \\frac{Ec\_e}{R\_e}$

$\\frac{D}{R} = \\frac{D}{R\_o + R\_c + R\_i + R\_e} = \\frac{D\_o}{R\_o} + \\frac{D\_c}{R\_c} + \\frac{D\_i}{R\_i} + \\frac{D\_e}{R\_e}$

One or more of the flows may be (set to) null depending on the question
or type of process investigated.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### **Net outcomes versus outcomes associated with consumption of resources gains and losses ass**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### **Resource consumption elasticities of D, I, Ec**

log(*v**a**r*) = *a* + *b* \* log(*R*<sub>*c*</sub>)

*e**l**a**s**t**i**c**i**t**y* = *ϵ* = *b*

**Research question**

Rank variables with regard to *b*. Assume other model than linear?

Variables with high cross-country resource elasticities should be
scrutinized for more in-depth analysis. E.g. outliers within continents
or development stages with partiularly high or low resource use per
sustainability outcome.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### **Elasticity of consumed resources to consumption balance**

log(*v**a**r*) = *a* + *b* \* log(*R*<sub>*c**i*</sub>) + *c* \* log(*R*<sub>*c**e*</sub>)

Where *R*<sub>*c**i*</sub> and *R*<sub>*c**e*</sub> are the resources
consumed through imports and domestic extraction, respectively.

***Assuming equal proportional contributions to export from extracted
and imported resources***

$\\log(var) = a + b \* \\log \\left( R\_i \* \\left(\\frac {R\_i}{R\_c+R\_o} \\right) \\right) + c \* \\log \\left( R\_e \* \\left(\\frac{R\_e}{R\_c+R\_o} \\right) \\right)$

***Assuming exports first by domestic resources, then by imported
resources of vice versa***

Needs to be filled in.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### **Elasticity of consumption balance**

$\\log(var) = a + b \* \\log \\left(\\frac{\\left( R\_{ce} - R\_{ci} \\right)}{\\left( R\_{ce} + R\_{ci} \\right)}\\right)$

Where *R*<sub>*c**i*</sub> and *R*<sub>*c**e*</sub> are the resources
consumed through imports and domestic extraction, respectively.

***Assuming equal proportional contributions to export from extracted
and imported resources***

$\\log(var) = a + b \* \\log \\left( \\frac{\\left( R\_{e} - R\_{i} \\right)}{\\left( R\_{e} + R\_{i} \\right)} \*  \\frac{\\left( R\_{c} \\right)}{\\left( R\_{c} + R\_{o} \\right)} \\right)$

    -   *QoG variables*

    -   4.9.2 ciri\_disap **Disappearance** (1981-2011). Disappearances
        are cases in which people have disappeared, political motivation
        appears likely, and the victims have not been found. Knowledge
        of the whereabouts of the disappeared is, by denition ,not
        public knowledge. However, while there is typically no way of
        knowing where victims are, it is typically known by whom they
        were taken and under what circumstances. A score of 0 indicates
        that disappearances have occurred frequently in a given year; a
        score of 1 indicates that disappearances occasionally occurred;
        and a score of 2 indicates that disappearances did not occur in
        a given year.

    -   4.9.8 ciri\_kill **Extrajudicial Killing** (1981-2011).
        Extrajudicial killings are killings by government ocials
        without due process of law. They include murders by private
        groups if instigated by government. These killings may result
        from the deliberate, illegal, and excessive use of lethal force
        by the police, security forces, or other agents of the state
        whether against criminal suspects, detainees, prisoners, or
        others. A score of 0 indicates that extrajudicial killings were
        practiced frequently in a given year; a score of 1 indicates
        that extrajudicial killings were practiced occasionally; and a
        score of 2 indicates that such killings did not occur in a given
        year.

    -   4.9.10 ciri\_physint **Physical Integrity Rights Index**
        (1981-2011). This is an additive index constructed from the
        Torture, Extrajudicial Killing, Political Imprisonment, and
        Disappearance indicators. It ranges from 0 (no government
        respect for these four rights) to 8 (full government respect for
        these four rights).

    -   4.9.14 ciri\_tort **Torture** (1981-2011). Torture refers to the
        purposeful inicting of extreme pain, whether mental or
        physical, by government ocials or by private individuals at the
        instigation of government ocials. Torture includes the use of
        physical and other force by police and prison guards that is
        cruel, inhuman, or degrading. This also includes deaths in
        custody due to negligence by government ocials. A score of 0
        indicates that torture was practiced frequently in a given year;
        a score of 1 indicates that torture was practiced occasionally;
        and a score of 2 indicates that torture did not occur in a given
        year.

    -   4.23.1 gd\_ptsa **Political Terror Scale - Amnesty
        International** (N=188, 1976-2012, [1:5]). Political Terror
        Scale Levels: 5. Terror has expanded to the whole population.
        The leaders of these societies place no limits on the means or
        thoroughness with which they pursue personal or ideological
        goals. 4. Civil and political rights violations have expanded to
        large numbers of the population. Murders, disappearances,and
        torture are a common part of life. In spite of its generality,
        on this level terror aects those who interest themselves in
        politics or ideas. 3. There is extensive political imprisonment,
        or a recent history of such imprisonment. Execution or other
        political murders and brutality may be common. Unlimited
        detention, with or without a trial, forpolitical views is
        accepted. 2. There is a limited amount of imprisonment for
        nonviolent political activity. However, few persons are aected,
        torture and beatings are exceptional. Political murder is rare.
        1. Countries under a secure rule of law, people are not

    -   *CoQ variables*

        -   4.9.1 ciri\_assn **Freedom of Assembly and Association**
            (1981-2011). It is an internationally recognized right of
            citizens to assemble freely and to associate with other
            persons in political parties, trade unions, cultural
            organizations, or other special-interest groups. This
            variable indicates the extent to which the freedoms of
            assembly and association are subject to actual governmental
            limitations or restrictions (as opposed to strictly legal
            protections). A score of 0 indicates that citizens' rights
            to freedom of assembly or association were severely
            restricted or denied completely to all citizens; a score of
            1 indicates that these rights were limited for all citizens
            or severely restricted or denied for select groups; and a
            score of 2 indicates that these rights wer virtually
            unrestricted and freely enjoyed by practically all citizens
            in a given year.

        -   4.9.4 ciri\_empinx\_new **Empowerment Rights Index (New)**
            (1981-2011). This is an additive index constructed from the

            Freedom of Assembly and Association, Workers' Rights,
            Electoral Self-Determination, and Freedom of Religion
            indicators. It ranges from 0 (no government respect for
            these seven rights) to 14 (full government respect for these
            seven rights).

        -   4.9.5 ciri\_empinx\_old **Empowerment Rights Index (Old)**
            (1981-2011). This is an additive index constructed from the
            Freedom of Movement, Freedom of Speech, Workers' Rights,
            Political Participation, and Freedom of Religion indicators.
            It ranges from 0 (no government respect for these ve
            rights) to 10 (full government respect for these ve
            rights). Note: Starting wit hthe 2007 coding, this variable
            was retired in favor of the newer index ciri\_empinx\_new.

        -   4.9.11 ciri\_polpris **Political Imprisonment** (1981-2011).
            Political imprisonment refers to the incarceration of people
            by government ocials because of their speech; their
            non-violent opposition to government policies or leaders;
            their religious beliefs; their non-violent religious
            practices including proselytizing; or their membership in a
            group, including an ethnic or racial group. A score of 0
            indicates that there were many people imprisoned because of
            their religious, political, or other beliefs in a given
            year; a score of 1 indicates that a few people were
            imprisoned; and a score of 2 indicates that no persons were
            imprisoned for any of the above reasons in a given year.

        -   4.9.13 ciri\_speech **Freedom of Speech** (1981-2011). This
            variable indicates the extent to which freedoms of speech
            and press are aected by government censorship, including
            ownership of media outlets. Censorship is any form of
            restriction that is placed on freedom of the press, speech
            or expression. Expression may be in the form of art or
            music. A score of 0 indicates that government censorship of
            the media was complete; a score of 1 indicates that there
            was some government censorship of the media; and a score of
            2 indicates that there was no government censorship of the
            media in a given year.

        -   4.20.1 fh\_cl **Civil Liberties** (N=207, 1972-2012,
            [1:7])Civil liberties allow for the freedoms of expression
            and belief, associational and organizational rights, rule of
            law, and personal autonomy without interference from the
            state. The more specic list of rights considered vary over
            the years. Countries are graded between 1 (most free) and 7
            (least free).

        -   4.20.3 fh\_fotpsc5 **Freedom of the Press, Score
            (2001-2012)** (N=196, 2001-2012, [0:100]) The press freedom
            index is computed by adding three component ratings: Laws
            and regulations, Political pressures and controls and
            Economic Inuences. The scale ranges from 0 (most free) to
            100 (least free).

    -   *QoG variables*

        -   "**Contestation and Inclusiveness, (1950-2000)** These are
            the two principal components of 13-15 indicators of
            democracy, including those compiled by Freedom House;
            Polity; Arthur Banks; Alvarez, Cheibub, Limongi, and
            Przeworski, as updated by Cheibub and Gandhi; Bollen; and
            Cingranelli and Richards. The dataset covers most countries
            in the world from 1950 through 2000. In an article in the
            Journal of Politics (July 2008), Angel Alvarez, Claudia
            Maldonado, and I argue that these principal components,
            which capture 75 percent of variation in the most commonly
            used democracy indicators, measure Robert Dahl's two
            dimensions of polyarchy: contestation and inclusiveness. We
            recommend that scholars use the standardized versions of
            these components (CONTESTstd and INCLUSstd), which have been
            adjusted to be comparable from year to year."

        -   4.9.7 ciri\_injud **Independence of the Judiciary** This
            variable indicates the extent to which the judiciary is
            independent of control from other sources, such as another
            branch of the government or the military. A score of 0
            indicates "not independent"", a score of 1 indicates
            "partially independent"" and a score of 2 indicates
            "generally independent".

        -   4.20.4 fh\_ipolity2 **Freedom House/Imputed Polity** (N=207,
            1972-2012, [0:10]). Scale ranges from 0-10 where 0 is least
            democratic and 10 most democratic. Average of Freedom House
            (fh\_pr and fh\_cl) is transformed to a scale 0-10 and
            Polity (p\_polity2) is transformed to a scale 0-10. These
            variables are averaged into fh\_polity2. The imputed version
            has imputed values for countries where data on Polity is
            missing by regressing Polity on the average Freedom House
            measure. Hadenius & Teorell (2005) show that this average
            index performs better both in terms of validity and
            reliability than its constituent parts.

        -   4.20.5 fh\_polity2 **Freedom House/Polity** (N=179,
            1972-2012, [0:10]). Scale ranges from 0-10 where 0 is least
            democratic and 10 most democratic. Average of Freedom House
            (fh\_pr and fh\_cl) is transformed to a scale 0-10 and
            Polity (p\_polity2) is transformed to a scale 0-10. These
            variables are averaged into fh\_polity2.

        -   4.20.6 fh\_pr **Political Rights** (N=207, 1972-2012,
            [0:7]). Political rights enable people to participate freely
            in the political process, including the right to vote freely
            for distinct alternatives in legitimate elections, compete
            for public oce, join political parties and organizations,
            and elect representatives who have a decisive impact on
            public policies and are accountable to the electorate. The
            specic list of rights considered varies over the years.
            Countries are graded between 1 (most free) and 7 (least
            free).

        -   4.20.7 fh\_status **Status** (N=207, 1972-2012, [0:7]). (1)
            Free. (2) Partly Free. (3) Not Free. Until 2003, countries
            whose combined average ratings for Political Rights and
            Civil Liberties fell between 1.0 and 2.5 were designated
            "Free""; between 3.0 and 5.5 "Partly Free"", and between 5.5
            and 7.0 "Not Free". Since then, countries whose ratings
            average 1.0 to 2.5 are considered "Free"", 3.0 to 5.0
            "Partly Free", and 5.5 to 7.0 "Not Free".

        -   4.28.2 h\_polcon3 **Political Constraints Index III**
            (N=201, 1946-2012, [0:1]). This index measures the
            feasibility of policy change, i.e. the extent to which a
            change in the preferences of any one political actor may
            lead to a change in government policy. The index is composed
            from the following information: the number of independent
            branches of government with veto power over policy change,
            counting the executive and the presence of an eective lower
            and upper house in the legislature (more branches leading to
            more constraint); the extent of party alignment across
            branches of government, measured as the extent to which the
            same party or coalition of parties control each branch
            (decreasing the level of constraint); and the extent of
            preference heterogeneity within each legislative branch,
            measured as legislative fractionalization in the relevant
            house (increasing constraint for aligned executives,
            decreasing it for opposed executives). The index scores are
            derived from a simple spatial model and theoretically ranges
            from 0 to 1, with higher scores indicating more political
            constraint and thus less feasibility of policy change. Note
            that the coding reects information as of January 1 in any
            given year. Henisz (2002) uses this index to demonstrate
            that political environments that limit the feasibility of
            policy change are an important determinant of investment in
            infrastructure.

        -   4.33.1 icrg\_qog **ICRG Indicator of Quality of Government**
            (N=147, 1984-2012, [0:1]). The mean value of the ICRG
            variables "Corruption"", "Law and Order" and "Bureaucracy
            Quality", scaled 0-1. Higher values indicate higher quality
            of government.

        -   4.9.3 ciri\_dommov **Freedom of Domestic Movement**
            (1981-2011) This variable indicates citizens' freedom to
            travel within their own country. A score of 0 indicates that
            this freedom was severely restricted, a score of 1 indicates
            the freedom was somewhat restricted, and a score of 2
            indicates unrestricted freedom of foreign movement.

-   crime (???safety???)

    -   Risk of victimization (OXFAM UK report)

        -   17% of adults were victims of crime within the past 12

-   sense of support

    -   People lacking satisfying work (UK OXFAM report)

        -   10% of people have little or no support in times of need (UK
            2012)

-   economic freedoms

    -   4.21.2 \_index\_cl Economic Freedom of the World Index
        (chain-linked) (N=123, 1970-2010, [0:10]). One problem with the
        version of the index of economic freedom (\_index) is that the
        underlying data is more complete in recent years than in earlier
        years. As a result, changes in the index ratings over time may
        reect the fact that some components are missing in some years
        but not in others.The problem of missing components threatens
        the comparability of the index ratings over time. In order to
        correct for this problem, the Fraser Institute has constructed a
        chain-linked summary index of economic freedom that is based on
        the 2000 rating as a base year. Changes to the index going
        backward (and forward) in time are then based only on changes in
        components that were present in adjacent years. The chain-linked
        methodology means that a country's rating will change across
        time periods only when there is a change in ratings for
        components present during both of the over-lapping years. This
        is precisely what one would want when making comparisons across
        time periods.

    -   4.29.1 hf\_corrupt Freedom from Corruption (N=183, 1994-2013,
        [0:10]). This factor relies on Transparency International's
        Corruption Perceptions Index (CPI), which measures the level of
        corruption in 152 countries, to determine the freedom from
        corruption scores of countries that are also listed in the Index
        of Economic Freedom. The CPI is based on a 10-point scale in
        which a score of 10 indicates very little corruption and a score
        of 0 indicates a very corrupt government. In scoring freedom
        from corruption, the authors convert each of these raw CPI data
        to a 0-100 scale by multiplying the CPI scores by 10.

    -   4.29.2 hf\_escore **Economic Freedom Index** (N=183, 1994-2013,
        [0:10]). The Economic Freedom index uses 10 specic freedoms,
        some as composites of even further detailed and quantiable
        components: Business freedom (hf\_business), Trade freedom
        (hf\_trade), Fiscal freedom (hf\_scal), Freedom from government
        (hf\_govt), Monetary freedom (hf\_monetary), Investment freedom
        (hf\_invest), Financial freedom (hf\_nanc), Property rights
        (hf\_prights), Freedom from corruption (hf\_corrupt), Labor
        freedom (hf\_labor). Each of these freedoms is weighted equally
        and turned into an index ranging from 0 to 100, where 100
        represents the maximum economic freedom. Although changes in
        methodology have been undertaken throughout the measurement
        period, continuous backtracking has been used to maximize
        comparability over time.

    -   4.29.3 hf\_govt **Freedom from Government** (N=182, 1994-2013,
        [0:100]). Scoring of the freedom from government factor is based
        on two components: Government expenditure as a percentage of
        GDP, Revenues generated by state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and
        property as a percentage of total government revenue. Government
        expenditure as a percentage of GDP is weighted as two-thirds of
        the freedom from government factor score, and revenue from SOEs
        is weighted as one-third. In cases where SOE data does not
        exist, the data is excluded from the factor score. The country's
        freedom from government ranges between 0 and 100, where 100
        represents the maximum degree of freedom from government.

    -   4.29.5 hf\_prights **Property Rights** (N=180, 1994-2013,
        [0:100]). This factor scores the degree to which a country's
        laws protect private property rights and the degree to which its
        government enforces those laws. It also accounts for the
        possibility that private property will be expropriated. In
        addition, it analyzes the independence of the judiciary, the
        existence of corruption within the judiciary, and the ability of
        individuals and businesses to enforce contracts. The less
        certain the legal protection of property is and the greater the
        chances of government expropriation of property are, the higher
        a country's score is. The country's property rights score ranges
        from 0 and 100, where 100 represents the maximum degree of
        protection of property rights.

    -   4.29.6 hf\_trade **Trade Freedom** (N=182, 1994-2013, [0:100]).
        The trade freedom score is based on two inputs: The
        trade-weighted average tari rate, Non-tariff barriers (NTBs).
        Weighted average taris is a purely quantitative measure and
        accounts for the basic calculation of the score. The presence of
        NTBs in a country aects its trade freedom score by incurring a
        penalty of up to 20 percentage points, or one-fth of the
        maximum score. The country's trade freedom ranges between 0 and
        100, where 100 represents the maximum degree of trade freedom.

-   "S2.3. Methodological Limitations. Recent advances in global MRIO
    modeling (2, 12) now provide the means to analyze and monitor the MF
    of nations more reliably than before. However, the method is not
    without limitations. MRIO accounts are provided initially in
    monetary terms rather than physical terms. So-called "price errors"
    can be introduced where individual transactions occur with a
    different price (dollars per quantity) than average. Allocation
    errors can occur due to low sectoral or product resolution. For
    example, a kilogram of gold included in a broad category of
    materials (e.g., "ores") allocated to a broad production sector
    (e.g., "metals and mining") will not be traced to its final demand
    as accurately as if gold were differentiated as a distinct input
    category and the MRIO used distinguished, more specific "gold,"
    "precious metals," or "nonferrous metals" sectors rather than a
    broad metals and mining sector. In this study, we differentiated 35
    types of materials and the MRIO used between 25 and 510 industrial
    sectors per country (5). For countries with more raw
    material-producing sectors, the allocation of DE data are therefore
    more accurate than for countries where fewer such sectors are
    available. For example, if there is just one "aggregate" extraction
    sector, a part of the "building stone" material flow might be
    allocated to the chemical industry because some limestone (which is
    also extracted by the aggregate"

-   "The limited resolution of some national input-output tables also
    constrains the method's ability in addressing issues around critical
    metals and resource security due to the facts that (i) many of the
    critical metals are "specialty metals," which are use for very
    specific applications that cannot be easily represented by flows
    between aggregate sectors/products, and (ii) resource security
    roblems often arise from the presence of mono- or oligopoly
    structures within a sector. This is an area where hybrid approaches
    can be very useful. Here, input-output analysis (IOA) is combined
    with elements from process-based life cycle assessment (LCA)
    methods, such as those applied by Schoer et al. (13) in a study of
    the raw material consumption (RMC) of the European Union (EU). The
    hybrid method takes advantage of truncation-free enumeration of
    supply chains via IOA and productspecific detail via LCA (14-16).
    The current framework provides an important first step toward
    understanding potential risks associated with the global resource
    supply chain. More detailed information can be added targeting the
    hotspots identified through a hybrid approach, where
    process-specific information and aggregate product-level information
    are integrated. More general elaborations on the uncertainty of"

COMPARISON OF THE MRIO APPROACH TO TMC AND TMR
==============================================

TMR - Total Material Requirement

TMC - Total Materical Consumption

From (Wiedmann et al. 2013)

-   "To calculate TMC and TMR, material intensity factors of imports and
    exports are derived from simplified life cycle inventories (4, 25).
    A drawback of this LCA factor method is that "that the ecological
    rucksack of a good which is passing more than one border in one or
    different process stages is counted more than one time within the
    volume" (4). This double-counting problem does not occur inMF
    calculations based on IOA because DE volumes are merely reallocated
    from production to consumption in a mutually exclusive and
    collectively comprehensive way. A further complication of the factor
    method used in TMC/TMR calculations is that coefficients of indirect
    material flows of imports and exports are mostly derived from
    specific production systems, such as Germany or the EU (25).""
